                  company.<br><br>4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR
                  INFORMATION?<br><br>In Short: We keep your information for
                  as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this
                  privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.<br><br>We
                  will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
                  necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice,
                  unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by
                  law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No
                  purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal
                  information for longer than the period of time in which users
                  have an account with us.<br><br>When we have no ongoing
                  legitimate business need to process your personal information,
                  we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if
                  this is not possible (for example, because your personal
                  information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
                  securely store your personal information and isolate it from
                  any further processing until deletion is possible.<br><br>5.
                  HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?<br><br>In Short: We
                  aim to protect your personal information through a system of
                  organizational and technical security measures.<br><br>We
                  have implemented appropriate technical and organizational
                  security measures designed to protect the security of any
                  personal information we process. However, despite our
                  safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no
                  electronic transmission over the Internet or information
                  storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we
                  cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or
                  other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat
                  our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify
                  your information. Although we will do our best to protect your
                  personal information, transmission of personal information to
                  and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only
                  access the Website within a secure environment.<br><br>6.
                  WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?<br><br>In Short: In some
                  regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA) and United
                  Kingdom (UK), you have rights that allow you greater access to
                  and control over your personal information. You may review,
                  change, or terminate your account at any time.<br><br>In
                  some regions (like the EEA and UK), you have certain rights
                  under applicable data protection laws. These may include the
                  right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal
                  information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii)
                  to restrict the processing of your personal information; and
                  (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain
                  circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the
                  processing of your personal information. To make such a
                  request, please use the contact details provided below. We
                  will consider and act upon any request in accordance with
                  applicable data protection laws.<br><br>If we are relying
                  on your consent to process your personal information, you have
                  the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note
                  however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the
                  processing before its withdrawal, nor will it affect the
                  processing of your personal information conducted in reliance
                  on lawful processing grounds other than consent.<br>
                  <br>If you are a resident in the EEA or UK and you believe
                  we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you
                  also have the right to complain to your local data protection
                  supervisory authority. You can find their contact details
                  here:
                  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.<br><br>If
                  you are a resident in Switzerland, the contact details for the
                  data protection authorities are available here:
                  https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html.<br><br>If
                  you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you
                  may email us at contact@cvbuilderpro.com.<br><br>Account
                  Information<br><br>If you would at any time like to review
                  or change the information in your account or terminate your
                  account, you can:<br>Log in to your account settings and
                  update your user account.<br>Contact us using the contact
                  information provided.<br>Upon your request to terminate your
                  account, we will deactivate or delete your account and
                  information from our active databases. However, we may retain
                  some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot
                  problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of
                  Use and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.<br><br>Opting
                  out of email marketing: You can unsubscribe from our marketing
                  email list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in
                  the emails that we send or by contacting us using the details
                  provided below. You will then be removed from the marketing
                  email list — however, we may still communicate with you, for
                  example to send you service-related emails that are necessary
                  for the administration and use of your account, to respond to
                  service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes. To
                  otherwise opt-out, you may:<br>Contact us using the contact
                  information provided.<br><br>7. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK
                  FEATURES<br><br>Most web browsers and some mobile
                  operating systems and mobile applications include a
                  Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to
                  signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
                  online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this
                  stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
                  implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do
                  not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
                  mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to
                  be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
                  adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you
                  about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
                  notice. <br><br>8. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC
                  PRIVACY RIGHTS?<br><br>In Short: Yes, if you are a
                  resident of California, you are granted specific rights
                  regarding access to your personal information.<br><br>California
                  Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The

                  we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes
                  and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we
                  shared personal information in the immediately preceding
                  calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like
                  to make such a request, please submit your request in writing

                  that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is
                  not publicly displayed on the Website, but please be aware
                  that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed
                  from all our systems (e.g. backups, etc.).<br><br>9. DO WE
                  MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE? <br><br>In Short: Yes, we
                  will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with
